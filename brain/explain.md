# Summary

## first paragraph

The add_knowledge_with_vm function in the KnowledgeGraph class is designed to augment a batch of sentences 
with knowledge from a knowledge graph and generate a visible matrix for each sentence. Here is a detailed explanation 
of its functionality and the significance of its return values:

## Parameters

sent_batch: A list of sentences to be processed.

max_entities: Maximum number of entities to associate with each word (default is defined in the config).

add_pad: Boolean indicating whether to pad sentences to max_length.

max_length: Maximum length of the processed sentences.

## Functionality

1. Initialization:

    Create empty lists for know_sent_batch, position_batch, visible_matrix_batch, and seg_batch.

2. Processing Each Sentence:

        For each sentence in sent_batch, initialize variables know_sent, pos, seg, and visible_matrix.
        Segment the sentence using the tokenizer.
        Construct a parse tree for the sentence based on the knowledge graph lookup table.

3. Building Knowledge-Augmented Sentence:

    For each word in the segmented sentence, add the word to know_sent. If the word is a special tag, add it directly, otherwise, split the word into characters and add each character.
    Update the position (pos) and segmentation (seg) lists.
    For each entity related to the word, add the entity’s characters to know_sent and update pos and seg accordingly.

4. Creating Visible Matrix:
    Initialize a zero matrix for visibility.
    For each item in the parse tree, update the visibility matrix to indicate which tokens are visible to each other.

5. Padding and Truncation:

    If know_sent is shorter than max_length, pad know_sent, pos, seg, and visible_matrix to max_length.
    If know_sent is longer than max_length, truncate these lists/matrices to max_length.

6. Appending to Batches:
    the processed sentence, position, visibility matrix, and segmentation information to their respective batches.

## Return Values

•  know_sent_batch: A list of knowledge-augmented sentences. Each sentence is represented as a list of tokens (characters or words, depending on segmentation).
• position_batch: A list of position indices for each token in the knowledge-augmented sentences.
• visible_matrix_batch: A list of visibility matrices, where each matrix indicates which tokens in a sentence are visible to each other based on the knowledge graph.
• seg_batch: A list of segmentation labels indicating whether a token is part of the original sentence (0) or an added knowledge entity (1).

## Significance

The function enhances the original sentences with additional knowledge from the knowledge graph and provides structured information about token positions and visibility, which can be useful for further processing in NLP tasks.
